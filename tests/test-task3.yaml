# Task 3 Test Configuration - Active Range Mapping
# Examples showing different range configurations

# Small range (useful for limited travel curtains)
- type: custom:better-curtain-card
  mode: single
  entity: cover.bedroom
  range:
    min: 20
    max: 80

# Combined with direction (up) + range
- type: custom:better-curtain-card
  mode: single
  entity: cover.kitchen
  direction: up
  range:

  mode: single
  entity: cover.bathroom

# Invalid range examples (should show errors):
# 1. min >= max
# - type: custom:better-curtain-card
#   mode: single
#   entity: cover.error1
#   range:
#     min: 80
#     max: 20

# 2. Values outside 0-100 (should be clamped)

#   entity: cover.error2
#   range:
#     min: -10
#     max: 110
